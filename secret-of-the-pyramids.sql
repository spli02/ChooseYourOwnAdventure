"I have to get some new equipment to continue my investigations of the Pyramids. How would you like to go back with me for a few weeks?"</p><p>You have always envied <NOBR>Bruce—dashing</NOBR> off to exotic places in the Middle East and the Orient, sometimes vanishing for months at a time.

(2, 2, '<p>The next few days are a blur of preparations. Before you know it, you and Bruce are on a TWA jet heading for Rome on the first leg of the trip to Cairo.</p><p>On the plane, your uncle explains his plan to place special instruments in a chamber under the center of the largest pyramid at Giza. He hopes to test the pyramid''s effect on the paths of cosmic <NOBR>rays—rays</NOBR> made up of <NOBR>high-speed</NOBR> particles from space that usually penetrate deep into the ground.</p><p>"If my theory is correct," he says, "these rays could be concentrated by the pyramid to produce an unlimited amount of energy."</p><p>While Bruce is talking, you notice that a man nearby is straining to hear him. No doubt he''s just curious. He is <NOBR>strange-looking,</NOBR> though!</p><p>In Rome you change to an Egyptair jet You are startled to notice the same man from the other jet aboard your <NOBR>Cairo-bound</NOBR> plane.</p><p>"I will have lots of red tape to take care of at the airport when we land," says Bruce. "Why don''t you just breeze through customs and take a cab to the Star and Crescent Hotel, where we''re staying? My assistant, Andrea, will be waiting there for you. She can get you settled in our room while my equipment is unloaded from the plane."</p><p>As soon as you land, Bruce is off to the baggage area, leaving you alone in a foreign land. As if that isn''t enough, the stranger from the plane appears and hands you a small, folded piece of paper, then dashes toward the taxi stand outside the terminal.</p>', 0),
(3, 3, '<p>Quickly you unfold the note. Scrawled in red ink are the words "Beware the Sphinx."</p><p>You have heard about the statue of the Sphinx next to the Pyramids. But why should you beware of it? The thought occurs to you that "sphinx" could be a code word and not refer to the actual Sphinx at all. Maybe the note is a meaningless hoax. On the other hand, it could spell danger for you and Bruce.</p><p>You remember the time you felt an urge to get off a bus in your <NOBR>hometown—just</NOBR> before it was hit by a truck. Now you have a hunch that you should follow this man.</p>', 0),
(4, 4, '<p>There''s no telling what kind of trouble you might get into if you just run off after this guy without really knowing where you are going.</p><p>You toss your bag into the back of a cab. "Star and Crescent Hotel," you tell the driver. When you arrive, Andrea is waiting for you in</p><p>the lobby. She helps you check in.</p><p>The bellboy insists on carrying your bag, even though you are traveling light. As you leave the elevator and head for your room, you could swear that the door, which was slightly ajar, closed as you approached. Maybe it was the wind, but the air seems very still. And after that warning note at the airport, you don''t want to take any chances.</p><p>"Wait," you say. "I don''t want this room. I don''t like the location."</p><p>The bellboy looks confused, and Andrea seems shocked. You haven''t had a chance to tell her about the note.</p><p>"I''ll explain later," you tell Andrea. "Right now I''m going to go back down to the lobby and ask for a different room."</p><p>But at the <NOBR>check-in</NOBR> desk, the clerk will not listen to you. What will you do?</p>', 0),

"It''s a good thing this limo is <NOBR>armor-plated."</NOBR></p><p>Mohammed has been on the <NOBR>two-way</NOBR> police radio from the moment you jumped into the car. Now information comes back that the police are surrounding the area.</p><p>"They won''t catch anyone," says Mohammed. "These terrorists are professionals. They will disappear back into the old quarter of the city in a matter of minutes."</p><p>Two police jeeps arrive almost immediately. Policemen begin to fan out around the area, You and Mohammed transfer to one of the jeeps, and it speeds off to Inspector Ahmed''s villa, its siren wailing.</p>', 0),
(6, 7, '<p>Bruce finally agrees to let you stay awhile longer. "But we''ll have to be very careful," he warns.</p><p>Neither of you is in the mood to go back to sleep. You leave a note under Andrea''s door and go down to the lobby. Even though it is only the earliest dawn, the back streets of Cairo are bustling with activity. At one of the broader intersections, you find a cab and direct the driver to take you to Giza.</p><p>When you arrive, an Egyptian friend of your uncle is already there: Mr. Hassan, the Egyptian Director of Antiquities. It was Hassan who first persuaded your uncle to come to Egypt many years ago.</p><p>The three of you look down into the deep pit that contains the entrance to the tunnel under the pyramid. Nearby the Sphinx sits in its ageless pose.</p><p>"We had a slight problem finishing the tunnel," says Hassan.

"Enjoy your <NOBR>sight-seeing."</NOBR></p><p>Mohammed drives you out to the famous Pyramids at Giza. A group of tourists is gathering at the foot of the largest one.</p><p>"Why don''t we join this group?" suggests Mohammed. "It is the safest way, and you will find it informative."</p><p>You have never liked official tours of any sort— you are too <NOBR>independent—but</NOBR> you see the logic of Mohammed''s suggestion. As the group starts into the pyramid, you and Mohammed fall in behind. You enter a low, narrow passageway which leads to a large gallery with a high ceiling. The guide begins a long, dull lecture.</p><p>"Do we have to follow this tour?" you ask Mohammed.</p><p>"If I may presume to suggest an alternative," says Mohammed, "I myself was once employed as a guide in this very pyramid. If you would like me to show you some of the lesser passageways, I would be glad to guide you."</p>', 0),

The humming grows even louder now. You feel compelled to exchange your clothes for the long robe, the headdress, and the sandals in front of you. You put them on. You want to stop yourself, but you can''t.</p><p>7M&</p>', 0),
(9, 11, '<p>Bruce seemingly agrees to cooperate, and Ptah is delighted. Bruce is sent under guard to work in the laboratory located in a vast complex under the pyramid.</p><p>A few days later, Bruce manages to talk to you without the guards overhearing.</p><p>"The Russian scientists were also kidnapped," whispers Bruce. "Fortunately I can speak a little Russian. We''re trying to come up with a way to escape."</p><p>Three weeks later, the ray gun is ready for its first formal test. You, Bruce, and the Russians— as well as Ptah and his top <NOBR>henchmen—mount</NOBR> a large ceremonial stand in front of the pyramid. As Ptah watches the barrel of the ray gun emerge from the top of the pyramid, Bruce slips something into your hand.</p><p>"Put these plugs in your ears when I give you the signal," Bruce whispers.</p><p>Technicians inside the pyramid throw the switches to activate the ray gun. A low whirring sound fills the air. It rises in pitch as it gets <NOBR>louder—louder</NOBR> and louder, and higher and higher. Soon it begins to hurt your ears. Your arms and legs become numb, and your vision starts to blur.</p>', 0),
(10, 12, '<p>"Inspector . . . Inspector Ahmed!" sputters the clerk.</p><p>"What is the trouble here?" asks the inspector.

I was afraid something like this might happen."</p><p>"I think I saw the kidnappers in a truck behind the hotel," you report anxiously.</p><p>You and the inspector run to the back entrance of the hotel, but the truck is gone.</p>', 0),

"I speak much English, <SPAN class="ft7">meestehr."</SPAN></p><p>"Good, then follow that cab," you tell him. Your cab weaves in and out of the heavy traffic, with its horn blaring constantly. Your driver just barely misses one car after another. However, he does manage to keep less than a block behind the</p><p>other car.</p><p>The <NOBR>fast-moving</NOBR> traffic slows to a snail''s pace once you get into an older section of the city. The cab you are following stops, and the strange man gets out. You hand your driver a couple of American bills, hoping they cover your fare. Fortunately, the driver seems more than pleased as you leave the cab.</p><p>You can barely see through the thick crowd, but you do catch a glimpse of the man you are following. He is entering what looks like a cafe. You push your way over to the entrance.</p>', 0),
(12, 14, '<p>You tell Ahmed that you would rather go back to the hotel, try to find Andrea, and get her opinion before you do anything.</p><p>You return to the hotel in a cab and check Andrea''s room. No sign of her. You leave the hotel not quite knowing what to do.</p><p>At the corner a native woman, with a dark veil covering her head and face, except for the eyes, beckons from a doorway. You are surprised to see that her eyes are pale gray. You are even <SPAN class="ft18">more </SPAN>surprised when you hear her voice. The woman is Andrea in disguise!</p><p>"Follow me quickly," she says.</p><p>You have to run to keep up with her. She leads you through a labyrinth of teeming alleyways. Finally you reach a stone building with a heavy, carved door.</p>', 0),
(13, 16, '<p>There may be dangers involved, but you can''t let your uncle down. You tell the inspector you will go with him on the raid.</p><p>"We will leave at dawn tomorrow," says Ahmed. "It is not advisable for you to go back to your hotel. My personal bodyguard will escort you today, and tonight he will bring you to my home, where you will spend the night. Perhaps you would like to tour the Pyramids today."</p><p>"It might keep my mind off Bruce until tomorrow," you say.</p><p>"Then let''s step outside," Ahmed says.</p><p>As you do, a long, black Mercedes limousine pulls up.</p><p>"This car is bulletproof, among other things," says Ahmed. "You will find it quite comfortable— and safe."</p>', 0),
(14, 17, '<p>You slide down the drainpipe to the balcony below, and then begin to lower yourself to the street. You try not to look down. Carefully you reach around with your foot for whatever footholds you can find sticking out from the building. It is easier than you had expected.</p><p>Finally you make it down to the street. You can still see the truck. It''s only a block away, stuck in traffic. You push your way through the crowded street as fast as you can to catch up to it</p><p>Out of breath, you reach the back of the truck. You jump on and struggle with the doors. They fly open suddenly, and you fall back onto the street, banging your knee. Hopping painfully on one leg, you get up and pull yourself into the truck.</p>', 0),
(15, 18, '<p>A screen slowly appears in one of the walls, and what looks like a movie about ancient Egypt begins. You see a pyramid being built. Workers scurry about with ropes and long poles. But they do not carry the huge blocks of stone. The stones float through the air by themselves!</p>', 0),
(16, 19, '<p>A few of the workers carry devices which project a beam of light onto the blocks</p><p>and cause them to rise in the air. Other workers toss ropes over the enormous floating blocks and lead them along, while the workers with the poles push the blocks gently into place. Amazing!</p>', 0),
(17, 20, '<p>Another guard appears at the door of the room.</p><p>"Ahmed won''t be coming back," he says. "All of us left at the villa are members of the Assassins. We have infiltrated Ahmed''s organization."</p><p>Two other members of the Assassins enter the room, guns drawn. They lead you down to a dungeon in the basement of the villa and chain you to an iron ring set in the stone wall.</p><p>You realize that you''re going to be a "guest" of the Assassins for a very long time.</p><p>The End</p>', 1),
(18, 21, '<p>"That looks as if it might be a kind of monorail," says Bruce. "See, that big plastic bubble travels on the rail out through a circular tunnel on the far side. I''ve suspected for a long rime that something like this might exist It confirms a theory of mine that ancient Egyptian culture was given a big boost by a more advanced one."</p><p>The door of the bubble is open, and Bruce jumps inside. His hand sweeps over the complex control panel.</p><p>"I think I see how this thing works," says Bruce. "Let''s give it a try. Of course, we don''t know what dangers lie ahead. This time," Bruce says to you, "you definitely should stay behind to go for <NOBR>help—just</NOBR> in case we don''t get back."</p>', 0),
(19, 23, '<p>It is suddenly very quiet in the next room. "Bruce, are you all right?" you call through the</p><p>door. There is no answer. You throw open the door. Bruce is gone!</p><p>The room is a mess. Sheets trail across the floor as if a struggle had taken place. In several places there are drops of blood. The screen covering the window has been pushed in. There are more spots of blood on the windowsill and on the small ledge outside. You look down. There is a fourstory drop to the street.</p><p>You rush back into your room and throw on some clothes. Then back to the window. It is a bit lighter now. Dawn is just breaking. On the street you see two men, loading a large basket into the back of an old panel truck. From this <NOBR>height—and</NOBR> in the <NOBR>still-dim</NOBR> <NOBR>light—you</NOBR> can''t be sure, but something tells you that one of them is the stranger who gave you the note. You also have a strong suspicion that your uncle is in the basket. How did they get him down to the street?</p><p>The ledge outside the window extends only a short distance on either side. There are no other windows nearby. But there are several small balconies on the second and third floors. There is also a drainpipe on one side of the ledge. Maybe you could slide down the drainpipe to the nearest balcony and then climb down to the street.</p><p>You''re in a panic. What should you do?</p>', 0),
(20, 24, '<p>One by one you, Bruce, and Hassan slide down the rope into the chamber below. It is a large room. In the center are huge chunks of rock and other debris that must have fallen from the ceiling. At one end of the room is a door leading toanother chamber.</p><p>As you approach the door it opens automatically. This startles all of you for a moment. Carefully you peer inside. You are hardly prepared for what you see.</p><p>The room is illuminated with some kind of strange light. The walls and ceiling are made of a plastic material with a honeycomb pattern, and they seem to glow with an inner luminescence. In the center, perched on a glistening metal rail, is some kind of futuristic device.</p>', 0),
(21, 26, '<p>It is very late when you get back to the hotel. You are weary from the plane trip and the experiences of the day. You fall asleep instantly. Bruce is in the adjoining room.</p><p>At dawn, something startles you awake. You hear sounds of a struggle in Bruce''s room. Quick as a cat, you spring out of bed and run to the door.</p>', 0),
(22, 27, '<p>The throne room is a large circular hall surrounded by ornate columns, decorated in the style of ancient Egypt.</p><p>"Ah, my friends. Sit over here by the fountain," says a short man wearing a large turban overloaded with jewels and multicolored feathers. "I''m so glad that you accepted my invitation to visit. I see that you two appear to have bumped your heads together. Most unfortunate. I''ll see to it that my infirmary looks after your injuries."</p>', 0),
(23, 28, '<p>"If it will help me rescue Bruce, I''ll join," you say.</p><p>"Then step into the triangle on the ground in front of you," says the speaker.</p><p>You look down. <NOBR>Strange—the</NOBR> triangle has the same design as the coin you tossed down the shaft, only much larger. As you step forward, a strong energy floods through you, and an intense light surrounds your body. You close your eyes but the light''s brightness does not diminish.</p><p>Suddenly you are caught up in a whirlwind and shot straight up through the pyramid. You look down and see the pyramid receding below you. The top of the pyramid has become a huge, glistening eye, shooting rays of light in all directions. Below it are bands of glowing color. As you concentrate on the eye, your body seems to dissolve. <SPAN class="ft21">You </SPAN>become the <NOBR>eye—all-seeing,</NOBR> <NOBR>all-know-</NOBR> ing. Your mind expands to encompass the universe, to fill infinite space. All the mysteries of existence are now understandable.</p><p>Your mind and body return to earth. Suddenly you <SPAN class="ft21">know </SPAN>where Bruce is being held. With your new powers you contact him telepathically. Later the police are amazed when you are able to lead them directly to the hideout of the Assassins— where Bruce has been <NOBR>imprisoned—in</NOBR> one of the old quarters of Cairo.</p><p>From now on, you will find a whole new life of joy and dangers.</p><p>The End</p>', 1),
(24, 29, '<p>Quickly you wrap the pillow around the snake, dash to the closet, hurl the snake and pillow inside, and slam the closet door shut.</p><p>You stand for a full minute with your back against the door. Your heart is still pounding. You feel weak in the knees as you realize what you''ve just done.</p><p>You wake your uncle and tell him about the snake.</p><p>"First that warning <NOBR>note—and</NOBR> now this attack!" exclaims Bruce. "It seems that someone is out to stop our little expedition by any means."</p><p>"But why?" you ask.</p><p>"I may be closer than I thought to unlocking the secret of unlimited energy. At least someone out there seems to think so. We''d better get you back to the States before something worse happens."</p>', 0),
(25, 30, '<p>"Let''s get to the car."</p><p>"There''s an exit to our right that doesn''t seem to be covered," says Mohammed. "I will count to five. Then we will get up from the table and move as quickly as we can out that door. Don''t run unless they start shooting, then keep low. Ready? One, two, three, four, five."</p><p>Your feet feel like lead, and even though you know you are moving as fast as you can, it feels like slow motion. Somehow you make it through the exit and into the car. You look back to see armed figures running in your direction. The car roars away from the curb. WHAM! Something smacks the car with terrific force.</p>', 0),
(26, 31, '<p>"I must compliment you on your escape," says Ahmed, when you arrive. "It was your coolheadedness that saved you."</p><p>"It was really Mohammed''s quick thinking that did it," you reply.</p><p>"Now that you see what kind of dangers we face," says Ahmed, "I will understand if you change your mind about joining the raid tomorrow.</p>', 0),
(27, 32, '<p>Your threat of going to another hotel seems to do the trick. The clerk sighs and mutters something about tourists. Nevertheless, he directs the porter to carry your bag to a new room.</p><p>"What is this all about?" asks Andrea.</p><p>"I''m not sure myself, but a man at the airport handed me a warning note. If we are in danger, changing our room may throw our pursuer off, or at least show him we are on our guard."</p><p>"Well, I think this is a lot of nonsense," Andrea says.</p><p>Your new "suite" consists of two small rooms with a connecting door. The first room is windowless; the second has a small window covered by a screen of very elaborate grillwork. Andrea''s room is on the other side of the hotel, not far from your original room.</p><p>Bruce arrives a short time later. You tell him about the warning note and explain why you''ve changed rooms.</p><p>"Splendid!" he exclaims. "You must always follow your hunches, especially when danger is involved. Now I suggest that we go out on the town for the evening. You don''t want to miss the Sahara Club and its famous belly dancers."</p>', 0),
(28, 33, '<p>"I think we had better go down to my office," says Ahmed. "I want you to look through my photo file."</p><p>The inspector''s office at headquarters is cluttered but organized in its own way. A row of file cabinets lines one side of the room. Ahmed pulls out a folder, opens it on one of the few bare sections of his long desk, and spreads out a collection of photographs for you to study.</p><p>Somehow you are not surprised to see the man from the plane in one of the photos. You tell Ahmed the whole story.</p><p>"The man you recognize is a member of the Assassins," says Ahmed. "This just confirms what I told you before. Through informers, I have discovered the secret desert headquarters of the Assassins. There is a strike force of paratroopers and a dozen helicopters waiting to attack. We must act as soon as possible."</p><p>"If you are going to raid the hideout of the kidnappers," you say, "I think I should go along."</p><p>"It is true that Professor Hockney is your uncle," says Ahmed. "However, this mission may prove to be very dangerous. I advise you not to go, but of course the decision is yours."</p>', 0),
(29, 34, '<p>"Anything would be better than this lecture," you say. "Those other passageways sound exciting."</p><p>You follow Mohammed into a narrow tunnel. At one point he stops and feels along the wall. One of the stones in the wall slides back, and a small, very low door opens.</p><p>"Quickly," says Mohammed, "we must get inside before anyone comes." Mohammed enters the long, horizontal shaft. The passageway is so low that you have to crawl on your hands and knees. You hear a click as the stone door behind you slides back into place. You hope Mohammed knows where he is going!</p><p>You and Mohammed crawl for quite a while. Finally you come to a large square chamber. The walls are white with blue and gold hieroglyphs painted in neat rows around the room. In the exact center of the floor is a round hole.</p><p>"That is what we call the Well of the Ancients," says Mohammed.</p><p>"You mean that you can draw water from down there?"</p><p>"There are many things other than water that can be drawn from a <NOBR>well—wisdom,</NOBR> perhaps," replies Mohammed. "This well is very deep. <NOBR>Here—drop</NOBR> this in the well and see if you can hear when it hits bottom."</p>', 0),
(30, 35, '<p>Mohammed hands you a small coin. It is triangular with an elaborate design in the center. A tiny, just barely visible hieroglyphic inscription runs around the edge. The coin shines as if made of gold.</p><p>You throw the coin in and put your ear close to the well. For a full minute you hear nothing. Then you hear a strange <NOBR>humming—a</NOBR> high musical note that vibrates both in the well and inside your head. You turn to look at Mohammed, but he seems to have disappeared.</p><p>Suddenly you feel as if you are losing your balance. You are falling into the well.</p>', 0),
(31, 36, '<p>Maybe jet lag and your imagination are getting the best of you.</p><p>"Never mind," you tell the desk clerk.</p><p>You go back up to the room and unpack your small suitcase. You make a careful search. There is no sign that an intruder has been there, and you feel relieved. Your room turns out to be a suite, with a bedroom, a sitting room, a small bathroom, and two tiny closets. The bedroom windows are covered with elaborately patterned grillwork. Andrea''s room is on the same floor, down the hall.</p><p>Bruce finally arrives and you show him the note. For a moment he looks alarmed. Then he smiles. "Well, I suggest we forget about it for the moment and go out on the town," he says. "I know this great spot called the Sahara Club where we can get a delicious meal of shish ke- <NOBR>bab—and</NOBR> even watch some genuine Egyptian belly dancing."</p><p>When you arrive back at the hotel later, you are very tired. Andrea goes to her room, Bruce retires to the bedroom, and you quickly fall asleep on the couch in the sitting room.</p>', 0),
(32, 37, '<p>The rhythmic beat of Middle Eastern music hits your ears as you go inside. There is a heavy smell of incense. A belly dancer sways in the center of the dance floor. You find a table off in a dim corner. You can''t see the man you followed, but your eyes are still adjusting to the darkness.</p>', 0),
(33, 38, '<p>"We''ve got to go down there now. My uncle may be in grave danger."</p><p>You and Ahmed start down the side of the dune toward the pyramids.</p><p>Suddenly a troop of desert warriors on camels appears from nowhere and comes charging toward you. Dark headcloths cover their faces except for their eyes. But instead of the old, long rifles you have seen them carrying in pictures, they all have modern submachine <NOBR>guns—and</NOBR> they are all pointed at you.</p><p>One of the warriors commands you to raise your hands and march toward the pyramids.</p><p>A door opens in the base of one of the smaller pyramids, and you and Ahmed are forced into the vault inside. The door snaps shut behind you. You realize that the "floor" you''re standing on is a conveyor belt that is rapidly carrying you toward a wall of flame at the other end of the vault. You try frantically to run back to the door, but the belt is too fast. You are both swept into the thermal <NOBR>chamber—a</NOBR> chamber that so concentrates the energy of the sun that any object entering it is instantly vaporized.</p><p>The End</p>', 1),

I greet you from the past"</p><p>"For a while there I thought we were in the past," you say.</p><p>"No, I am not actually here at the moment, and you are not back in ancient Egypt. This is a <NOBR>recording—a</NOBR> <NOBR>three-dimensional</NOBR> hologram. My image is programmed to respond to individual personalities such as yours.

It is too complex to explain, but your descendants will understand someday, just as <SPAN class="ft23">you </SPAN>know that when you listen to a radio there are not little people in the box making the sounds."</p><p>"You are the most celebrated character in Egyptian history," says Hassan. "You <NOBR>were—or</NOBR> <NOBR>are—the</NOBR> greatest genius that ever lived."</p><p>"It is true that I gave your species a bit of help. I taught them the rudiments of architecture, farming, mathematics, engineering, and medicine. That was five thousand years ago. But I am not sure I was wise to do it. I will have to decide that when I find time to return.

(35, 40, '<p>You, Bruce, and Hassan climb down a ladder into the deep pit. At the bottom, a <NOBR>six-foot-square</NOBR> opening penetrates the side wall. A perfectly straight tunnel of the same dimensions goes into the <NOBR>rock—horizontal</NOBR> for a short way, then sloping sharply downward. The three of you enter it.</p><p>A hand rope along the wall keeps you from slipping. Your flashlight beams cut into the darkness ahead. Finally you come to a circular room about twelve feet in diameter, directly beneath the center of the pyramid.</p><p>"This is strange, <SPAN class="ft18">very </SPAN>strange," says Hassan. "Yesterday this floor was completely smooth, almost polished. Now there is a pattern of cracks over here and part of the floor has sunk."</p><p>Suddenly there is a cracking noise.</p><p>"Get back to the tunnel!" shouts Bruce. "The floor is caving in."</p>', 0),

(37, 44, '<p>"I shouldn''t have waited," you say, downcast. "I should have climbed down the wall of the hotel and tried to stop them before they got away."</p><p>"No," says the inspector, "you did the right thing. These men are fanatics. They probably would have shot you down."</p><p>"You know the men who did this?"</p><p>"They are members of an ancient terrorist group known as the Society of Assassins. They know that your uncle is working on a way to produce enormous amounts of energy.

You reach the point where the shaft goes down, but now the hand rope is missing. Where are you? In a panic you run back the other way. Your heart is pounding and your palms are sweaty.</p><p>Now you edge carefully forward, pointing your flashlight down seemingly endless passageways. You reach a fork in the tunnel. You don''t remember a fork there before! Your hands and knees are shaking, but you force yourself to go on. More forks! You have somehow blundered into a maze of tunnels.</p><p>You stop for a moment to think. How can you possibly find your way out? Then you remember a rule to follow when you''re trapped in a maze: "Every time you reach a fork, turn right." Remembering this calms your nerves somewhat. Now maybe you have a chance.</p><p>Wearily you start to retrace your steps. You just hope that the rule works. At best you know that it will be a long walk.</p><p>The End</p>', 1),
(76, 92, '<p>You and Ahmed fly on, taking a last desperate chance. Ahmed is a good pilot, but the storm is too much for the small helicopter. The turbulent air outside is a swirling yellow haze.

It is already afternoon," he says. "Our best bet is to head west, toward the sun. Later we can follow it as it sets. In the morning we will head away from the rising sun. If the sun becomes obscured by haze, we will stay where we are. Otherwise we will run the risk of wandering around in circles."</p><p>You start off. Up and down sand dunes, and then up and down again.

Ahmed is strangely calm.</p><p>"I''m sorry, but that is just a <NOBR>mirage—a</NOBR> trick the desert plays on the eyes, my friend," he says.</p><p>After another mile or so of hiking, you realize that Ahmed is right. Nothing is there. Sheets of water seem to materialize, then vanish after you have walked a few yards.</p><p>A few hours later, you stop suddenly. "Ahmed, am I crazy or do I hear thunder in the distance? Are there sound mirages in the desert?"</p>', 0),
(78, 94, '<p>The submersible car journeys up the river, just under the surface of the water.</p><p>"Not long ago," says Bruce, "I discovered the entrance to an underwater tunnel that goes from the Nile to the famous step pyramid at Sakkara. They say Imhotep''s tomb is there. I haven''t had a chance to explore this tunnel until now."</p><p>When you reach Sakkara, the car enters the underwater runnel. Soon you surface on a broad lake in an underground cavern. In the center of the lake is an island, and in the center of the island is a small pyramid about thirty feet high. It is made of a dull, silvery <NOBR>metal—perhaps</NOBR> platinum. Bruce steers the car to the edge of the island. The three of you jump ashore. As you do, a large opening appears in the side of the pyramid. A voice comes from inside.</p><p>"If you wish to know the secret of Imhotep, and the secret of the Pyramids," says the voice, "then all of you must step inside."</p><p>"I guess it''s all or nothing," says Bruce.

You can''t seem to focus your eyes. Your arms and legs feel like lead, and you can''t move them. You feel dizzy. You feel like you are passing out!</p>', 0),
(80, 97, '<p>"OK," says Bruce, "let''s all three give it a shot." You feel a lot better going along than waiting</p><p>alone in that spooky room.</p><p>As soon as you are on board, Bruce pushes one of the buttons on the control panel. There is a whirring sound and the door of the strange craft slides shut with an ominous click.</p><p>The bubble starts smoothly along the rail and into the tunnel. After a minute or so, it slows to a stop. The bubble door opens and the three of you climb out. You find yourselves in a chamber almost identical to the one you just left. However, this room seems to have no exit. This does not seem logical to you. Whoever created this transportation system would hardly have built it just for the ride.</p><p>On a hunch, you feel carefully along the wall. Jackpot! Two triangular panels recess into the wall and slide apart, revealing a large room with slanted walls.</p><p>"Good work," says Bruce.</p><p>The three of you enter. As you look around you realize that you are in a room shaped like the inside of a pyramid.</p><p>Suddenly the triangular door closes behind you and disappears. You are trapped inside!

"This is not a mirage!"</p><p>You dunk your entire head in the water. Nothing has ever felt better in your life.</p><p>Later, when you are both rested, Ahmed says, "Some of these palm trees are date palms with fruit We will have enough food and water until the next caravan arrives.

Your uncle is on the phone.</p><p>"I''m just in from Egypt," he says. "I have to get some new equipment to continue my investigations of the Pyramids. How would you like to go back with me for a few weeks?"</p><p>This is really strange.

I was afraid that I had lost them. Each one of these will send out smoke for an hour."</p><p>Ahmed sets off one of the bombs. A tall column of smoke rises in the now still air.</p><p>The last one is set off late in the afternoon. "This is it," says Ahmed. "If no one sees this smoke, we may be out of luck."</p><p>Just as the smoke begins to disappear, you hear the drone of a plane. It banks and makes a low pass over you.</p><p>"They see us!" you shout, jumping up and down on the sand.</p><p>The plane, which belongs to the Egyptian Air Force, lands nearby. You are saved this time. You wonder how many adventures lie ahead before you get back to the States.</p><p>The End</p>', 1),

You are about to lose your grip when a strong arm grabs you by the wrist and heaves you onto the roof. It''s Serena!</p><p>"Wow!" you exclaim. "Are all belly dancers as strong as you are?"</p><p>"I was trained to be an acrobat by my family," she says, "before I was kidnapped by the evil gang that owns the cafe."</p><p>"Why haven''t you tried to escape before?" you ask.</p><p>"I have," she says, "but it''s not that easy.
